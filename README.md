# Titanic_Kaggle
Titanic_Kaggle â€“ My first hands-on project in data science and machine learning. Based on the well-known Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster", this exercise introduced me to essential steps of a data science workflow: data cleaning, exploration, modeling, and performance evaluation.
